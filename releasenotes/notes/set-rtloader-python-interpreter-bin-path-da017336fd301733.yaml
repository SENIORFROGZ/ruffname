    Python interpreter ``sys.executable`` is now set to the appropriate interpreter's
    executable path. This should allow ``multiprocessing`` to be able to spawn new
    processes since it will try to invoke the Python interpreter instead of the Agent
    itself. It should be noted though that the ``datadog_agent`` import should be
    guarded with ``try``/``except`` clauses and only used from within the main process
    as the ``rtloader``-injected helpers are not available in the child processes.
